This is a source distribution of MCPL - Monte Carlo Particle Lists.

Included are the core utilities for reading and writing .mcpl files: A binary
format with lists of particle state information, for interchanging and
reshooting events between various Monte Carlo simulation applications.

Hooks for Geant4 (geant4.cern.ch) and MCNP (SSW files) are included in this
distribution as well. Hooks for McStas (mcstas.org) are already included
directly upstream in McStas. A few examples of how to use the Geant4 hooks, or
how to interact with MCPL files from standalone C code, are also provided. Refer
to the FILES file for more information about included files, and refer to the
comment at the top of the CMakeLists.txt file for how to build and install with
CMake.

MCPL and most code distributed here was written 2015-2016 by Thomas Kittelmann
(thomas.kittelmann@esss.se). The MCNP-SSW converters were written in close
collaboration with Esben Klinkby (esbe@dtu.dk), and the McStas converters were
written by Erik Knudsen (erkn@fysik.dtu.dk) and Peter Willendrup
(pkwi@fysik.dtu.dk).

See the file LICENSE for usage conditions.

The latest version of MCPL and further instructions and documentation can be
found at the websites: http://cern.ch/mcpl and http://mcpl.mccode.org/.

Note that instructions for installation and setup of third-party products like
Geant4, McStas and MCNP are beyond the scope of this file. But for Geant4, a few
extra tips are given here, to avoid typical issues encountered by new users
(this was tested with Geant4 10.0.p03):

  1) Refer to the instructions at http://geant4.cern.ch/
  2) Provide the -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON flag to CMake during installation.
  3) After installation, source <geant4installdir>/bin/geant4.sh to set up
     a proper runtime environment.
