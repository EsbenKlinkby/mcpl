# MCPL : Monte Carlo Particle Lists

MCPL is a binary format for usage in physics simulations.

It contains lists of particle state information, and allows interchanging particles
between various Monte Carlo simulation applications. It is implemented i portable
C code and is made available to the scientific community, along with converters
and plugins for several popular simulation packages.

The repository and wiki is still being populated, please check back later.
