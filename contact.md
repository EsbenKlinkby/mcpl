Please report any bugs, feature requests, ideas, contributions or other issues
in the [issue tracker]({{site.github.issues_url}}). In particular we would be
happy to hear of anyone providing integrations with other Monte Carlo packages
than the ones already supported.

Contact via email to the [authors](LOCAL:about) is of course also very welcome. Email
addresses can be easily found in the online directories of the institutions
where we work ([ESS](https://europeanspallationsource.se/) or
[DTU](http://www.dtu.dk/)) by searching for our names.
