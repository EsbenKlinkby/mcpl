Welcome to the home of MCPL, a binary format for usage in physics simulations.

MCPL files contain lists of particle state information, and allows for easy
storage and interchange of particles between various Monte Carlo simulation
applications. It is implemented in portable C code and is made available to the
scientific community, along with converters and plugins for several popular
simulation packages.

The pages here are still missing lots of content, as we are currently busy
trying to get the first release of MCPL out of the door and published in a
scientific journal. Please check back later for more contents. In the meantime,
you can consult the preliminary draft of our first intended publication: {%
include linkpaper.html %}, which already contains a lot of hopefully useful
information.

Likewise, feel free to try out the code in the current condition by downloading
the latest MCPL distribution using the [tar.gz]({{site.github.tar_url|replace:
"/gh-pages","/master"}}), [zip]({{site.github.zip_url|replace:
"/gh-pages","/master"}}) or [github]({{site.github.repository_url}}) links
above.
