LICENSE             : License conditions
VERSION             : File containing the version of the distribution
FILES               : This file
examples/           : Small standalone examples for reading and writing MCPL
                      files, either from standalone C applications or through
                      Geant4 simulations in C++.
CMakeLists.txt      : Configuration file for optionally building and installing
                      via CMake. It is mainly provided as an illustration of the
                      necessary build steps, and many users would likely prefer
                      to simply copy MCPL files into their existing build system.
src/mcpl/           : Implementation of MCPL itself in C, along with the mcpltool
                      command line application. The file mcpl.h is the public
                      interface of MCPL and mcpl.c is the implementation.
src/geant4/         : MCPL hooks for Geant4 in C++, in the form of two classes
                      implementing respectively a G4VSensitiveDetector and a
                      G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction.
src/mcnpssw/        : MCPL hooks for MCNP in C, in the form of a few .h/.c file
                      pairs and two command line applications which can be used
                      to convert between the MCPL format and the SSW files used
                      by MCNP.
src/mcstas/         : No actual code is here, just a small reminder of how the
                      MCPL plugin shipped with McStas can be used.
src_fat/            : Various "fat" versions of files from the above directories
                      under src/, for convenience. These files are automatically
                      generated and might also contain code under the zlib
                      license.
src_fat/mcpl.c      : Replacement for src/mcpl/mcpl.c which includes zlib
                      sources internally (thus making transparent compression
                      available even when zlib is not available to the build
                      system).
src_fat/*_app.c     : Single-file versions of the command-line applications
                      mcpltool, mcpl2ssw and ssw2mcpl. These can be compiled
                      without the need for any external headers or libraries
                      (except math-lib: -lm), and includes both MCPL, zlib and
                      mcnpssw sources internally as needed.
